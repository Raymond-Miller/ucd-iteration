The Iterative Design Process: A Full Guide for UX Designers



I. Before Iteration

Now that you have a research report full of observations, insights, and recommendations, review these with your product team! Determine the next steps regarding design iterations or further research.

It can be helpful to let everyone use 3 dots (or emojis, or markers of some kind) to vote on the most important changes to make to help determine prioritization. Usually this comes from where your participants struggled most or ranked the experience lowest. From here you’ll cut design tickets (to redesign, perhaps), research tickets (to start or backlog additional research), and development tickets (for anything ready to build. 

You have some design tickets and you’re expected to improve the designs. Now what?
II. Iteration

It is virtually impossible to design a user interface that has no usability problems from the start. Even the best usability experts cannot design perfect user interfaces in a single attempt, so product design – and engineering as well – should be built around the concept of iteration.

In your research, you conducted tests that had results. You made some observations about those results and generated insights. You’ve now turned those insights into tactical actions – either to explore via additional research or practical adjustments you can make to your design. 

Make updates to the designs accordingly and then, even if just with a few users, or, in this case only, as a gutcheck, you can test internally if your project timelines don’t allow you to talk to more users. You’ll likely find additional issues. Fix what you can as you can – perfection is not the aim, but fixing fixable issues is your responsibility. 

Some of the benefits of iterative design are:

Create more usable products. 
Learn whether a product solves real user problems. 
Reduce the cost of production. 
Builds confidence in your product team

Pro tip: Embrace failure. 
One of the hardest things about iteration is seeing your ideas fail. But it’s really important to experience failure – most ideas will not work the way you expected them to play out. That’s why it is important to iterate like mad, trying out ideas, seeing what works and doesn’t work, evolving your design forward as you learn from your mistakes. Failure is like spicy food – it hurts at first, but then you acquire a taste for it – and soon you just can’t get enough. 

Remember, fall in love with problems, not solutions.
 
III. Consider the big picture, not just quick fixes 

Because of the fast-paced nature of iterative usability testing, it can be all too easy for a product team to get caught up in thinking only about quick fixes for usability issues. Make sure that the team takes the time to think about the bigger picture. Clearly identify the root causes of users’ pain points and seek holistic design solutions that fully address them. That’s the only way to ensure a design solution truly meets users’ needs.

In technology where everything is expected to be agile, quickly prototyped and shipped to market, it’s easy to forget that solid products don’t materialize out of the blue, without sufficient process to sustain their existence. 

Now you have done the testing and you have analyzed this data, planning out what’s right and what is wrong will then help you further your site's experience across multiple devices and users. Iterating what you have first done helps you understand how your customers are thinking and in turn make your business grow. Iterating what you have might feel like a waste of time and money, but it will make you more money, more conversions and bring more traffic to your site.

There are more tricks such as getting reports done on your site using development tools such as lighthouse, web.dev and even Google analytics. All of these will help your test and analyze your site on what areas, if any, need iterating for improvements.

Iteration is where we start the concept of 'Fail Fast'. The point of prototyping is to quickly demonstrate your idea for a product, feature or solution. It's almost guaranteed we will be wrong and we will fail on what we design. So, why take six months to two years to realize you failed, when you know you will from day one?
